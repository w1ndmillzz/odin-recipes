    <h1>Easy Brownies</h1>

    <h2>Easiest Brownies</h2>
     <p>For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies of my childhood.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
      </ol>
